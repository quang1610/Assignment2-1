The rate of Legionnaires' disease rose nearly fourfold in the U.S. between 2000 and 2014, and 
researchers are trying to figure out why. A new study offers some potential clues about the role 
of cooling towers, the equipment that expels waste heat from buildings' air conditioning or other 
systems.
Researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention analyzed water from 196 cooling 
towers across the U.S. for Legionella, the bacteria that cause the severe and sometimes-fatal 
form of pneumonia. They found live Legionella bacteria in 79 of them, in most regions of the 
country. Overall, they detected Legionella DNA -- indicating the bacteria were either present or 
had been there at some point -- in 164, or 84% of the cooling towers.
Cooling towers are known to be a major source of outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease, including a 
large outbreak in New York City's South Bronx in 2015 in which 138 people were sickened and 16 died. The bacteria can proliferate in the water system of cooling towers, then become airborne and inhaled.
The CDC study is the first to show how widespread Legionella may be in these devices across the 
country, its authors said.
"Legionella DNA is ubiquitous in U.S. cooling towers," said Anna Llewellyn, a fellow at the 
pneumonia response and surveillance laboratory at the CDC, who called the findings "surprising." 
That "highlights the potential for cooling-tower-related outbreaks to occur anywhere in the U.S."
Dr. Llewellyn cautioned that just because a tower has Legionella doesn't necessarily mean it is 
spreading disease. It isn't known how much Legionella makes a person sick.
