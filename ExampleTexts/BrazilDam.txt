Inspectors of a Brazilian mining-waste dam whose collapse last month killed at least 150 people had warned its owner that faulty water drainage and monitoring systems represented a potential risk of failure, according to a safety report reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

The report, provided to the mine’s owner Vale SA months before the disaster, found that flaws in monitoring crucial water concentrations and drainage made it difficult for the company to fully assess the dam’s stability.

TÜV SÜD, the company that inspected the dam and wrote a 128-page report for Vale in September, ultimately certified the dam as stable. But two independent mining dam experts who reviewed the report with the Journal said the dam shouldn’t have been certified and Vale should have recognized potential risks.

Minas Gerais federal police, who are investigating the incident, said on Wednesday that among the possible causes for the burst were an accumulation of water in the dam and a possible failure in its drainage system.

In a statement, Vale said it followed up on all recommendations laid out by TÜV SÜD’s inspection and described them as routine. It also said the dam was monitored by more than 130 instruments, and that this data were analyzed periodically.

It referred to TÜV SÜD’s ultimate conclusion that the dam was stable. Vale also said the dam met global safety standards for the industry and exceeded industry standards in Brazil.

TÜV SÜD said it was cooperating with the various investigations in Brazil, but because of those probes, it couldn’t provide further information.
