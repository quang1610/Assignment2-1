Dear Miss Frizielle:
I have not advocated social equality between colored and white people. That is a personal thing 
which nobody can advocate. Nobody can tell me whom I shall have inside my house, any more than I 
can tell others.
The only things which I have advocated are four basic rights which I believe every citizen in a 
democracy must enjoy. These are the right for equal education, the right to work for equal pay 
according to ability, the right to justice under the law, the right to participate in the making 
of the laws by use of the ballot.
Questions beyond that are personal things and people must decide them for themselves.
I am sure it is true that here in Washington you have found some discourteous colored people. 
I have found colored people who were discourteous, and I have also found white people who were 
discourteous. As a matter of fact, I doubt if it does any people anywhere any harm to tell them 
that you believe they are entitled to certain rights and you are willing to see them obtain those 
rights.
If you have to use the same toilets and wash basins where you work, then all of you must have to 
take physical examinations, in which case I think you are as safe as you would be in any place 
where a great many people are coming and going. If you are nervous, there are certain precautions 
which you can always take.
Sincerely yours,
Eleanor Roosevelt
