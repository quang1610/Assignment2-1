Conclusion and Feedback from test takers:
The participants in the testing were able to read the speed reader and comprehend nearly as well as normal reading, but faster. With practice, they would likely be able to read with normal comprehension at a much faster speed. 
The ability to change the wpm during the course of reading (wpm is not allowed to be changed in all our tests) could also improve comprehension by allowing readers to slow down or speed up when necessary. 
It is not clear, however, how much comprehension can be retained over the course of longer texts. It may not be possible to read at 500 wpm for very long.
