These ceramic figures of a Bactrian camel and groom were made over one thousand years ago in China
 for the tombs of wealthy aristocrats or merchants. Objects such as these, along with figures of 
 guardians, soldiers, and entertainers, were placed in tombs so that the spirit of the deceased
  person might have a rich and full afterlife similar to the life he or she had lived on earth. 
  China was the eastern end of the Silk Route (also called the Silk Road), some five thousand miles
   of roads linking Asia, the Middle East, and Europe, along which traders exchanged not only goods
    and services but also customs and languages. Two-humped Bactrian camels were ideal for carrying
     the trade goods. Standing seven feet tall at the hump, they can carry great weight, walk on 
     varied terrain with their large feet, and store fat in their humps, converting it to energy 
     or water on long journeys. The unknown artists who made these sculptures filled them with a 
     lively spirit. The camel twists its neck and opens its mouth to bray loudly. The groom raises
      his arm as if to control a stubborn camel with invisible reins. Attached to the camel’s 
      saddle you can see a water flask, a slab of smoked meat, and a saddlebag with a fanged 
      guardian face. The figures were coated with cream, amber, and green glazes, which still 
      shine brightly after a thousand years. The groom’s face and legs were not glazed, but 
      instead were originally painted with watercolors, which have faded away over time.
